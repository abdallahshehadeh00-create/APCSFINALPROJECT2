Pharmacy Management System (CS Project)
GitHub Repository: https://github.com/abdallahshehadeh00-create/APCSFINALPROJECT2

Features
 Inventory Management: Full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for medicine records.
 Real-time Search: Efficient filtering of medicines by name using FilteredList.
 Data Persistence: Automatic saving and loading of inventory using Google GSON and JSON.
 Modern UI: Built with JavaFX and FXML using the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern.

 Tech Stack
 Language: Java 17+
 Framework: JavaFX 17
 Build Tool: Maven
 Libraries: Google GSON (for JSON serialization)

 Project Structure
- src/main/java/com.example.csproject2
    - Medicine.java: The Data Model uses JavaFX Properties.
    - DashboardController.java: Logic and UI Event Handling.
    - JsonHandler.java: Utility for File I/O and GSON integration.
- inventory.json: Local database file for persistent storage.

 How to Run
1. Ensure you have Maven and Java 17 installed.
2. Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse.
3. Run mvn clean install.
4. Run the HelloApplication.java

 Design Decisions (For Grading)
 JSON over SQL: Decided on a JSON file structure for portability and lightweight deployment.
 Transient Properties: Utilized the transient keyword in the Medicine model to prevent serialization errors with JavaFX Property objects while maintaining UI binding.
 MVC Pattern: Strictly separated the GUI (FXML) from the Business Logic (Controller) to ensure code maintainability.
